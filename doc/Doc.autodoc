@Chapter Introduction

This package provides tools for exploring categorical machine learning using the CAP (Categories, Algorithms, Programming) system.
It implements automatic differentiation using the lens pattern and provides constructs for building and training neural networks.

@Section Overview

The package implements the following main concepts:

* **Category of Skeletal Smooth Maps**: A category where objects are Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ and morphisms are smooth maps with their Jacobian matrices.

* **Category of Lenses**: A category that models bidirectional data flow, essential for backpropagation in neural networks.

* **Category of Parametrised Morphisms**: A category that represents morphisms with learnable parameters, used to model neural network layers.

* **Expressions**: A symbolic expression system for representing mathematical formulas.

* **Neural Networks**: High-level operations for constructing and training neural networks.
